### **MLOps & Deployment**

With a strong focus on deploying scalable and production-ready machine learning models, I leverage the following **MLOps** tools and practices:

- **MLOps**:  
  🔄 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for ML models, version control for models using **DVC**, **MLflow** for model tracking and management, and **Kubeflow** for orchestrating ML pipelines.

- **Model Deployment**:  
  🚀 **Docker** & **Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration, enabling seamless model deployment in cloud environments and on-premise servers.

- **Cloud Platforms & Deployment**:  
  ☁️ **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Azure** for scalable, secure deployment of models. I utilize **AWS S3**, **Lambda**, and **Google Cloud Functions** for serverless deployment and **EC2** for large-scale model training and deployment.

- **API Development**:  
  🔧 **Flask**, **FastAPI** for creating REST APIs, enabling real-time predictions and integration with web applications.

- **Data Pipelines & Automation**:  
  ⚙️ **Apache Airflow** for managing workflows, **ETL pipelines** for data transformation and integration, and **Apache Spark** for handling large-scale data processing.

- **Monitoring & Logging**:  
  🧰 **Prometheus**, **Grafana** for monitoring model performance and system health, and **Sentry** for real-time error tracking.

### **Programming & Development Tools**

I use a combination of languages and development tools to ensure efficient model building and deployment:

- **Programming Languages**:  
  💻 **Python**, **SQL**, **PHP**

- **Frameworks & Libraries**:  
  🔧 **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Keras**, **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Hugging Face Transformers**

- **Version Control**:  
  ⚙️ **Git**, **GitHub**, **GitLab** for versioning, collaboration, and code sharing.

- **DevOps & Infrastructure**:  
  🏗️ **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform** for infrastructure automation, **CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing and deployment.
